# PS Business Suites

## Release Notes
- v7.4: Fixed syntax and navigation chain. Dashboard shows only upcoming warranties (3 & 60 days). Removed Products/Orders pages, kept tables for import integrity. Customers page supports Needs (product/unit). DD-MM-YYYY display, flexible importer + Excel serial dates. Login safe rerun for all Streamlit versions.
- v7.5: Fixed selectbox errors; "Add Customer" now supports Purchase/Warranty fields (date, product, model, serial, unit) and auto-creates warranty.
- v7.6: Admins can bulk-delete customers from the Customers page with a select-all option.
- v7.7: Importer allows blank column mappings and optional skipping of blank rows. Dashboard counts active warranties by expiry date. Customer summaries merge duplicate records and report how many were combined.
- v7.8: Customer summary groups unnamed customers under "(blank)" so their contact info is still accessible.
- v7.9: Staff can only submit the current day's daily report, file weekly updates on Saturdays, and record monthly reports for the active month. Client imports better distinguish repeat purchases with different generators to avoid duplicate flags.

## Run Without Touching the Command Line
These launchers create a dedicated virtual environment, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and then open the Streamlit app inside the native desktop shell (no browser required). After the first setup run the cached environment is reused automatically, so relaunching is instant. You only need Python 3.9+ installed. You can still run `streamlit run main.py` for the traditional browser experience—both approaches share the exact same database and uploads.

To launch the PS Business Suites by ZAD sales experience instead of the service CRM, set `PS_APP=sales` (or `PS_APP_SCRIPT=sales_app.py` when using the desktop launcher) before starting the application. The same unified requirements file and Procfile work for both apps on Render or Railway.

On hosting platforms that expect a Python entry point (such as Railway or Render), set the start command to `python render_bootstrap.py`. The bootstrapper mirrors the Procfile settings, respects the `PS_APP`/`PS_APP_SCRIPT` toggle, and will default to a persistent volume (for example `/data`) when one is available. The repository `Procfile` already uses the bootstrapper so you can leave the default command in place on Railway/Render deployments.

### Any Platform (single command or double-click)
Run `python run_app.py` from the repository root, or double-click the file in your file explorer. The script prepares the environment and launches the app inside a pywebview dialog titled **PS Business Suites**.

### Windows
1. Double-click `run_app.bat`.
2. Wait for the first run to finish creating the virtual environment and installing dependencies. A desktop window titled **PS Business Suites** will open automatically.
3. Subsequent launches skip the setup step—the cached environment is reused so the window opens right away.

### macOS & Linux
1. (First time only) Make the script executable: `chmod +x run_app.sh`.
2. Double-click `run_app.sh` in your file manager **or** run `./run_app.sh` from a terminal.
3. The script prepares the environment and opens the app inside a desktop window—no external browser involved. Future launches reuse the prepared environment.

## Build a One-Click Desktop App for Your Team
If your staff does not have Python installed, you can package the project into a standalone application and distribute it like a regular program.

1. On a machine with Python 3.9+ installed, open a terminal in the repository root.
2. Run `python build_executable.py`. The script creates a temporary virtual environment, installs PyInstaller, and produces a bundle inside `dist/PS Service Software/`. Subsequent builds reuse the cached environment unless `requirements.txt` changes.
3. Share the contents of `dist/PS Service Software/` with your staff. Windows users can double-click `PS Service Software.exe` (complete with the PS Service Software icon); macOS and Linux users can run the executable from Finder/File Explorer or the terminal.

### Where user data lives
Regardless of whether you launch from source, the packaged desktop app, or `streamlit run main.py`, databases, uploads, and the Excel import template are stored in a writable folder per operating system:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\ps-business-suites`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/ps-business-suites`
- **Linux:** `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/ps-business-suites`

Staff can back up or migrate the application by copying that folder. Deleting it resets the app to a clean state the next time the executable is opened.

### Linode (or any persistent volume) backups and privacy
For cloud deployments, point the data directory at your Linode volume so backups, uploads, and staff accounts live on durable storage:

- **CRM app:** set `APP_STORAGE_DIR=/data/ps-business-suites`.
- **Sales app:** set `PS_SALES_DATA_DIR=/data/ps-sales`.

Automatic monthly backups are written under `<data dir>/backups`. To keep a second copy, set `PS_CRM_BACKUP_MIRROR_DIR` or `PS_SALES_BACKUP_MIRROR_DIR` to another mounted volume or backup path. Each backup archive includes the SQLite database (staff accounts included), an SQL dump, Excel exports, and all stored files, plus a `checksums.txt` file for integrity verification—store these archives securely to preserve privacy.

## Troubleshooting
- If Python is not installed or not on your `PATH`, install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Windows) or via your package manager (macOS/Linux).
- To reset everything, delete the `.venv` folder and rerun the launcher to recreate a clean environment.
